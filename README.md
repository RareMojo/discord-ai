## Usage

After installation and configuration, the bot will run automatically. It uses the GPT model to interact with users in the specified Discord channel.

<br>

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the bot:

<br>

1. **Channel Setup**:
    - The bot can be set up in any channel of your Discord server. This is an example of a proper setup. Copy the category ID and paste it in the `.env` file. 
    - You do not need to have the same names or exact setup. This is just recommended. Just make certain you use the correct channel IDs.

2. **Thread Listing**:
    - This is an example of the thread listing within the threads section that is to be used for generic agent interaction.
    - Copy the thread channel ID and paste it in the `.env` file.
